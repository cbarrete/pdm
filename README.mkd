Introduction
============

Punishing Deathmatch (PDM) is an alternative deathmatch gametype for
[Warsow][wsw]. The only distinction from the default deathmatch is that the
score is measured not by frags, but by a numeric equivalent of the beauty of
the shots.

The basic rule of the gametype is that you have to move fast to get decent
score. See the description below for details of how the score is calculated.


Score
=====

The score you get depends on the following parameters:

1. Your speed.
2. Speed of your target.
3. Distance between you and your target.

The harder it is to hit the target (higher speeds, longer distance), the higher
score you'll get. If your score is less than DS, you'll instead lose a fraction
of your current score proportional to how much less than DS you did.

Here is the exact formula:

                  /            / Va'\2  /      min(Vta', Vtg') \   / Dat \ \
    score = floor | DS * ACF * |----| * | 1 + -----------------| * |-----| |
                  \            \ Nv /   \            Nv        /   \ Nd  / /

And if score < DS:

                 /       score - DS  \
    finalScore = | CS * ------------ |
                 \           DS      /
Where

* *DS* is the default score for a "normal" shot (100).
* *CS* is the current total score of the attacker.
* *ACF* is the anti-camper factor, see the description below.
* *Va'* is the projection of the attacker's velocity relative to ground to
  the flat surface that is perpendicular to the vector from the attacker
  to the target.
* *Vta'* is the projection of the target's velocity relative to the attacker to
  the flat surface that is perpendicular to the vector from the target to the
  attacker.
* *Vtg'* is the projection of the target's velocity relative to the ground to
  the flat surface that is perpendicular to the vector from the target to the
  attacker.
* *Nv* is the normal velocity (600).
* *Dat* is the distance between the attacker and the target.
* *Nd* is the normal distance (800).

Anti-camper factor
------------------

The idea behind the factor is to make camping uninteresting. We significantly
decrease score if the attacker's velocity is lower than the normal velocity
(*Nv*). If the velocity is noticeably higher than *Nv*, then ACF almost does
not affect the score (i.e. it's close to 1).

Here is the exact formula:

                /         / Va     \ \    pi
          arctan| scale * |---- - 1| | + ---
                \         \ Nv     / /    2
    ACF = ----------------------------------
                          pi

Where

* *Va* is the length of the player's velocity vector.
* *Nv* is the normal velocity (600).
* *scale* specifies how fast the factor grows (12).

And [here][acf_plot] is what it looks like.


Awards
======

There are four types of awards:

1. *nice shot* for a shot a score higher or equal than 500 and lower
   than 1000;
2. *awesome* for a shot a score higher or equal than 1000 and lower than 2500;
3. *mental* for a shot with a score higher or equal than 2500;
4. *sucks* for a shot with a score lower or equal than 0.


Notes
=====

Due to the nature of the gametype, it is not supposed to work with normal
weapons (i.e. with Instagib disabled).
